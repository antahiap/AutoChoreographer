Match Choreography to Music with Machine Learning

It can be difficult to find music that matches your desired choreography rhythm, especially if you have a specific topic in mind. This project aims to train a machine learning model to match available choreographies to music. The model will be trained on a dataset of choreographies and their corresponding music, and then used to recommend music for new choreographies.

To use the model, users would first record their body postures while performing the choreography. The model would then analyze the postures and recommend music that matches the rhythm. This could be useful for choreographers, dancers, and anyone else who wants to create their own choreographies.
